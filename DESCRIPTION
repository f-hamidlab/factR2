Description: factR contain tools to process and interact with custom-assembled 
    transcriptomes (GTF). At its core, factR constructs CDS information on 
    custom transcripts and subsequently predicts its functional output. 
    In addition,  factR has tools capable of plotting transcripts, 
    correcting chromosome and gene information and shortlisting new transcripts.
Depends: R (>= 4.2)
